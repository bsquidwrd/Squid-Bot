## R. Danny

A bot of many talents

## Running

I would prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot. Just call the join command with an invite URL to have it on your server. The source here is provided for educational purposes.

However...

You should only need one main configuration file while the rest will be created automatically.

#### credentials.json

```json
{
    "token": "your bot token",
    "client_id": "your client_id",
    "owner_id": "your user discord id"
}
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- Async version of discord.py
- lxml

## Thanks
